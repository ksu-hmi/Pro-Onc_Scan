### Sprint 1

[x] Define and name project

[x] Create Github repository within KSU-HMI organization
 
[x] Commit a readme.md file in the respective repository
  
[x] Explore an existing Python code related to project
    
    *Cloned code for Global-Entry repository- uses a Python script at a specific location to check for available appointments.  It utilizes APIs to support code function. 'locationId' can be modified to view availability at different geographical locations. The code has several commented out functions. The code must also be modified to accept user input. 

### Sprint 2

[x] Add initial sample code from "Global Entry" repository

[x] Make changes to customize code and test function and output

[x] Review Github for other code that can better meet the project objective
